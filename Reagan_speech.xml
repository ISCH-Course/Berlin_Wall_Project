                        ladies and gentlemen: <date when="1963-06-26">Twenty-four years ago</date>,
                        <persName ref="#Kennedy" role="president">President <forename type='first'>John</forename> <forename type='middle'>F.</forename> <surname>Kennedy</surname></persName>
                        visited Berlin, speaking to the people of this city and the world at the City Hall. Well, since then
                        <rs type="person">two other presidents</rs> have come, each in his turn, to Berlin. And <date when="1987-06-12">today</date> 
                        <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs>, myself, make my second visit to your city.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We come to Berlin, we American <rs type="person">presidents</rs>, because it’s our duty to speak, in
                        this place, of freedom. But <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> must confess, we’re drawn here by other things as
                        well: by the feeling of history in this city, more than 500 years older than our own
                        nation; by the beauty of the Grunewald and the Tiergarten; most of all, by your
                        courage and determination. Perhaps the composer <persName ref="#Lincke">Paul Lincke</persName> understood
                        something about American <rs type="person">presidents</rs>. You see, like so many <rs type="person">presidents</rs> before
                        me, <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> come here <date when="1987-06-12">today</date> because wherever <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> go, whatever <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> do: <foreign xml:lang="de">Ich hab noch einen
                        Koffer in Berlin.</foreign> [I still have a suitcase in Berlin.]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our gathering <date when="1987-06-12">today</date> is being broadcast throughout Western Europe and North
                        America. <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> understand that it is being seen and heard as well in the East. To those
                        listening throughout Eastern Europe, a special word: Although <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> cannot be with
                        you, <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> address my remarks to you just as surely as to those standing here before
                        me. For <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> join you, as <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> join your fellow countrymen in the West, in this firm, this
                        unalterable belief: <foreign xml:lang="de">Es gibt nur ein Berlin.</foreign> [There is only one Berlin.]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Behind me stands a wall that encircles the free sectors of this city, part of a vast
                        system of barriers that divides the entire continent of Europe. From the Baltic,
                        south, those barriers cut across Germany in a gash of barbed wire, concrete, dog
                        runs, and guard towers. Farther south, there may be no visible, no obvious wall.
                        But there remain armed guards and checkpoints all the same — still a restriction
                        on the right to travel, still an instrument to impose upon ordinary men and women
                        the will of a totalitarian state. Yet it is here in Berlin where the wall emerges most
                        clearly; here, cutting across your city, where the news photo and the television
                        screen have imprinted this brutal division of a continent upon the mind of the
                        world. Standing before the Brandenburg Gate, every man is a German, separated
                        from his fellow men. Every man is a Berliner, forced to look upon a scar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName ref="#Weizsacker" role="president">President von Weizsacker</persName> has said, “The German question is open as long as the
                        Brandenburg Gate is closed.” <date when="1987-06-12">Today</date> <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> say: As long as the gate is close, as long
                        as this scar of a wall is permitted to stand, it is not the German question alone
                        that remains open, but the question of freedom for all mankind. Yet <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> do not come
                        here to lament. For <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> find in Berlin a message of hope, even in the shadow of this
                        wall, a message of triumph.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this season of <date notBefore="1945-03-01" notAfter="1945-05-31">spring in 1945</date>, the people of Berlin emerged from their air-raid
                        shelters to find devastation. Thousands of miles away, the people of the <orgName>United
                        States</orgName> reached out to help. And in <date when="1947-06-05">1947</date> <persName ref="#Marshall" role="secretary_of_state">Secretary of State George Marshall</persName> — as you’ve been told — announced the creation of what would become known as the
                        Marshall Plan. Speaking precisely <date when="1947-06-05">40 years ago this month</date>, <rs type="person" ref="#Marshall">he</rs> said: “Our policy is
                        directed not against any country or doctrine, but against hunger, poverty,
                        desperation, and chaos.”
                    </p>
                    <p>In the <orgName>Reichstag</orgName> <date when="1987-06-12">a few moments ago</date>, <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> saw a display commemorating this 40th
                        anniversary of the Marshall Plan. <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> was struck by the sign on a burnt-out, gutted
                        structure that was being rebuilt. <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> understand that Berliners of my own generation
                        can remember seeing signs like it dotted throughout the western sectors of the
                        city. The sign read simply: “The Marshall Plan is helping here to strengthen the
                        free world.” A strong, free world in the West, that dream became real. Japan rose
                        from ruin to become an economic giant. Italy, France, Belgium — virtually every
                        nation in Western Europe saw political and economic rebirth; the <orgName>European
                        Community</orgName> was founded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In West Germany and here in Berlin, there took place an economic miracle, the
                        Wirtschaftswunder. <persName ref="#Adenauer" role="chancellor_of_west_germany">Adenauer</persName>, <persName ref="#Erhard" role="chancellor_of_west_germany">Erhard</persName>, <persName ref="#Reuter" role="governing_mayor_of_west_berlin">Reuter</persName>, and other leaders understood the
                        practical importance of liberty—that just as truth can flourish only when the
                        journalist is given freedom of speech, so prosperity can come about only when
                        the farmer and businessman enjoy economic freedom. The <rs type="person">German Leaders</rs>
                        reduced tariffs, expanded free trade, lowered taxes. <date from="1950" to="1960">From 1950 to 1960</date> alone, the
                        standard of living in West Germany and Berlin doubled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where <date when="1947">four decades ago</date> there was rubble, <date when="1987-06-12">today</date> in West Berlin there is the
                        greatest industrial output of any city in Germany — busy office blocks, fine homes
                        and apartments, proud avenues, and the spreading lawns of parkland. Where a
                        city’s culture seemed to have been destroyed, <date when="1987-06-12">today</date> there are two great
                        <orgName>universities</orgName>, orchestras and an opera, countless theaters, and museums. Where
                        there was want, <date when="1987-06-12">today</date> there’s abundance — food, clothing, automobiles — the
                        wonderful goods of the Ku’damm. From devastation, from utter ruin, you
                        Berliners have, in freedom, rebuilt a city that once again ranks as one of the
                        greatest on earth. The <orgName>Soviets</orgName> may have had other plans. But my friends,
                         there were a few things the <orgName>Soviets</orgName> didn’t count 
                        on — <foreign xml:lang="de">Berliner Herz, Berliner Humor, ja, und Berliner Schnauze. </foreign> 
                        [Berliner heart, Berliner humor, yes, and a Berliner
                        Schnauze.]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In <date when="1956-11-18">the 1950s</date>, <persName ref="#Khrushchev" role="first_secretary_of_the_communist_party_of_ the_soviet_union">Khrushchev</persName> predicted: “We will bury you.” But in the West <date when="1987-06-12">today</date>,
                        we see a free world that has achieved a level of prosperity and well-being
                        unprecedented in all human history. In the communist world, we see failure,
                        technological backwardness, declining standards of health, even want of the
                        most basic kind — too little food. Even <date when="1987-06-12">today</date>, the <orgName>Soviet Union</orgName> still cannot feed
                        itself. After these four decades, then, there stands before the entire world one
                        great and inescapable conclusion: Freedom leads to prosperity. Freedom
                        replaces the ancient hatreds among the nations with comity and peace. Freedom
                        is the victor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And now the <orgName>Soviets</orgName> themselves may, in a limited way, be coming to understand
                        the importance of freedom. We hear much from Moscow about a new policy of
                        reform and openness. Some political prisoners have been released. Certain
                        foreign news broadcasts are no longer being jammed. Some economic
                        enterprises have been permitted to operate with greater freedom from state
                        control.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Are these the beginnings of profound changes in the <orgName>Soviet state</orgName>? Or are they
                        token gestures, intended to raise false hopes in the West, or to strengthen the
                        Soviet system without changing it? We welcome change and openness; for we
                        believe that freedom and security go together, that the advance of human liberty
                        can only strengthen the cause of world peace. There is one sign the <orgName>Soviets</orgName> can
                        make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of
                        freedom and peace.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName ref="#Gorbachev" role="general_secretary_of_the_communist_party_of_ the_soviet_union">General Secretary Gorbachev</persName>, if <rs type="person" ref="#Gorbachev">you</rs> seek peace, if <rs type="person" ref="#Gorbachev">you</rs> seek prosperity for the
                        <orgName>Soviet Union</orgName> and Eastern Europe, if <rs type="person" ref="#Gorbachev">you</rs> seek liberalization: Come here to this

                    <p>
                        <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> understand the fear of ware and the pain of division that afflict this continent —
                        and <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> pledge to you my country’s efforts to help overcome these burdens. To be
                        sure, we in the West must resist <orgName>Soviet</orgName> expansion. So we must maintain defenses
                        of unassailable strength. Yet we seek peace; so we must strive to reduce arms on
                        both sides.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beginning <date when="1976-03">10 years ago</date>, the <orgName>Soviets</orgName> challenged the Western alliance with a grave
                        new threat, hundreds of new and more deadly SS-20 nuclear missiles, capable of
                        striking every capital in Europe. The Western alliance responded by committing
                        itself to a counter-deployment unless the <orgName>Soviets</orgName> agreed to negotiate a better
                        solution; namely, the elimination of such weapons on both sides. For many
                        months, the <orgName>Soviets</orgName> refused to bargain in earnestness. As the alliance, in turn, 
                        prepared to go forward with its counter-deployment, there were difficult days —
                        days of protests like those during my <date when="1982-06-11">1982</date> visit to this city — and the <orgName>Soviets</orgName> later
                        walked away from the table.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But through it all, the alliance held firm. And <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> invite those who protested then — <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs>
                        invite those who protest today — to mark this fact: Because we remained strong,
                        today we have within reach the possibility, not merely of limiting the growth of
                        arms, but of eliminating, for the first time an entire class of nuclear weapons from
                        the face of the earth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> speak, <orgName>NATO</orgName> <rs type="person">ministers</rs> are meeting in Iceland to review the progress of our
                        proposals for eliminating these weapons. At the talks in Geneva, we have also
                        proposed deep cuts in strategic offensive weapons. And the Western allies have
                        likewise made far-reaching proposals to reduce the danger of conventional war
                        and to place a total ban on chemical weapons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While we pursue these arms reductions, <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> pledge to you that we will maintain the
                        capacity to deter <orgName>Soviet</orgName> aggression at any level at which it might occur. And in
                        cooperation with many of our allies, the <orgName>United States</orgName> is pursuing the Strategic
                        Defense Initiative — research to base deterrence not on the threat of offensive
                        retaliation, but on defenses that truly defend; on systems, in short, that will not
                        target populations, but shield them. By these means we seek to increase the
                        safety of Europe and all the world. But we must remember a crucial fact: East and
                        West do not mistrust each other because we are armed; we are armed because
                        we mistrust each other. And our differences are not about weapons but about
                        liberty. When <persName ref="#Kennedy" role="president">President <surname>Kennedy</surname></persName> spoke at the City Hall those <date when="1963-06-26">24 years ago</date>,
                        freedom was encircled, Berlin was under siege. And <date when="1987-06-12">today</date>, despite all the
                        pressures upon this city, Berlin stands secure in its liberty. And freedom itself is
                        transforming the globe.

                        In the Philippines, in South and Central America, democracy has been given a
                        rebirth. Throughout the Pacific, free markets are working miracle after miracle of
                        economic growth. In the industrialized nations, a technological revolution is
                        taking place — a revolution marked by rapid, dramatic advances in computers and
                        telecommunications.

                        In Europe, only one nation and those it controls refuse to join the community of
                        freedom. Yet in this age of redoubled economic growth, of information and
                        innovation, the <orgName>Soviet Union</orgName> faces a choice: It must make fundamental changes,
                        or it will become obsolete.

                        <date when="1987-06-12">Today</date> thus represents a moment of hope. We in the West stand ready to
                        cooperate with the East to promote true openness, to break down barriers that
                        separate people, to create a safe, freer world. And surely there is no better place
                        than Berlin, the meeting place of East and West, to make a start. Free people of Berlin:
                        <date when="1987-06-12">Today</date>, as in the past, the <orgName>United States</orgName> stands for the strict observance

                        use this occasion, the 750th anniversary of this city, to usher in a new era, to seek
                        a still fuller, richer life for the Berlin of the future. Together, let us maintain and
                        develop the ties between the <orgName>Federal Republic</orgName> and the Western sectors of Berlin,
                        which is permitted by the <date when="1971">1971</date> agreement.

                        the city closer together, so that all the inhabitants of all Berlin can enjoy the
                        benefits that come with life in one of the great cities of the world.

                        To open Berlin still further to all Europe, East and West, let us expand the vital air
                        access to this city, finding ways of making commercial air service to Berlin more
                        convenient, more comfortable, and more economical. We look to the day when
                        West Berlin can become one of the chief aviation hubs in all central Europe.

                        With our French and British partners, the <orgName>United States</orgName> is prepared to help bring
                        international meetings to Berlin. It would be only fitting for Berlin to serve as the
                        site of <orgName>United Nations</orgName> meetings, or world conferences on human rights and arms
                        control or other issues that call for international cooperation.

                        There is no better way to establish hope for the future than to enlighten young
                        minds, and we would be honored to sponsor summer youth exchanges, cultural
                        events, and other programs for young Berliners from the East. Our French and
                        British friends, I’m certain, will do the same. And it’s my hope that an authority
                        can be found in East Berlin to sponsor visits from young people of the Western
                        sectors.

                        One final proposal, one close to my heart: Sport represents a source of
                        enjoyment and ennoblement, and you may have noted that the <orgName>Republic of
                        Korea</orgName> — <orgName>South Korea</orgName> — has offered to permit certain events of the <date when="1988">1988</date> Olympics
                        to take place in the North. International sports competitions of all kinds could
                        take place in both parts of this city. And what better way to demonstrate to the
                        world the openness of this city than to offer in some future year to hold the
                        Olympic games here in Berlin, East and West? In <date from="1947" to="1987">these four decades</date>, as <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> have
                        said, you Berliners have built a great city. You’ve done so in spite of threats — the
                        <orgName>Soviet</orgName> attempts to impose the East-mark, the blockade. Today the city thrives in
                        spite of the challenges implicit in the very presence of this wall. What keeps you
                        here? Certainly there’s a great deal to be said for your fortitude, for you defiant
                        courage. But <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> believe there’s something deeper, something that involves Berlin’s
                        whole look and feel and way of life — not mere sentiment. No one could live long
                        in Berlin without being completely disabused of illusions. Something instead that
                        has seen the difficulties of life in Berlin but chose to accept them, that continues
                        to build this good and proud city in contrast to a surrounding totalitarian
                        presence that refuses to release human energies or aspirations.
                        Something that speaks with a powerful voice of affirmation, that says yes to this city, yes to the future, yes to freedom.
                        In a word, <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> would submit that what keeps you in Berlin is love — love both profound and abiding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Perhaps this gets to the root of the matter, to the most fundamental distinction of all between East and West.
                        The totalitarian world produces backwardness because it does such violence to the spirit,
                        thwarting the human impulse to create, to enjoy, to worship.
                        The totalitarian world finds even symbols of love and of worship an affront.
                        <date from="1965" to="1969">Years ago</date>, before the East Germans began rebuilding their churches, they erected a secular structure:
                        The television tower at Alexander Platz. Virtually ever since, the authorities have been working to correct what they view as the tower’s
                        one major flaw, treating the glass sphere at the top with paints and chemicals of every kind.
                        Yet even today when the sun strikes that sphere — that sphere that towers over all Berlin — the light makes the sign of the cross.
                        There in Berlin, like the city itself, symbols of love, symbols of worship, cannot be suppressed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> looked out a moment ago from the <orgName>Reichstag</orgName>, that embodiment of German unity, <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> noticed words crudely spray-painted upon the wall,
                        perhaps by a young Berliner: “This wall will fall. Beliefs become reality.” Yes, across Europe, this wall will fall.
                        For it cannot withstand faith; it cannot withstand truth. The wall cannot withstand freedom.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> would like, before <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> close, to say one word. <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> have read, and <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> have been questioned since I’ve been here about
                        certain demonstrations against my coming. And <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> would like to say just one thing, and to those who demonstrate so.
                        <rs type="person" ref="#Reagan">I</rs> wonder if they have ever asked themselves that if they should have the kind of government they apparently seek,
                        no one would ever be able to do what they’re doing again.
