          <p class="speaker">Ronald Reagan</p>
          <p class="dialogue">
                        Chancellor Kohl,
                        Governing Mayor Diepgen,
                        ladies and gentlemen: Twenty-four years ago,
                        President John F. Kennedy
                        visited Berlin, speaking to the people of this city and the world at the City Hall. Well, since then
                        two other presidents have come, each in his turn, to Berlin. And today 
                        I, myself, make my second visit to your city.
                    </p>
          <p class="dialogue">
                        We come to Berlin, we American presidents, because it&#8217;s our duty to speak, in
                        this place, of freedom. But I must confess, we&#8217;re drawn here by other things as
                        well: by the feeling of history in this city, more than 500 years older than our own
                        nation; by the beauty of the Grunewald and the Tiergarten; most of all, by your
                        courage and determination. Perhaps the composer Paul Lincke understood
                        something about American presidents. You see, like so many presidents before
                        me, I come here today because wherever I go, whatever I do: Ich hab noch einen
                        Koffer in Berlin. [I still have a suitcase in Berlin.]
                    </p>
          <p class="dialogue">
                        Our gathering today is being broadcast throughout Western Europe and North
                        America. I understand that it is being seen and heard as well in the East. To those
                        listening throughout Eastern Europe, a special word: Although I cannot be with
                        you, I address my remarks to you just as surely as to those standing here before
                        me. For I join you, as I join your fellow countrymen in the West, in this firm, this
                        unalterable belief: Es gibt nur ein Berlin. [There is only one Berlin.]
                    </p>
          <p class="dialogue">
                        Behind me stands a wall that encircles the free sectors of this city, part of a vast
                        system of barriers that divides the entire continent of Europe. From the Baltic,
                        south, those barriers cut across Germany in a gash of barbed wire, concrete, dog
                        runs, and guard towers. Farther south, there may be no visible, no obvious wall.
                        But there remain armed guards and checkpoints all the same&#8212;still a restriction
                        on the right to travel, still an instrument to impose upon ordinary men and women
                        the will of a totalitarian state. Yet it is here in Berlin where the wall emerges most
                        clearly; here, cutting across your city, where the news photo and the television
                        screen have imprinted this brutal division of a continent upon the mind of the
                        world. Standing before the Brandenburg Gate, every man is a German, separated
                        from his fellow men. Every man is a Berliner, forced to look upon a scar.
                    </p>
          <p class="dialogue">
                        President von Weizsacker has said, &#8220;The German question is open as long as the
                        Brandenburg Gate is closed.&#8221; Today I say: As long as the gate is closed, as long
                        as this scar of a wall is permitted to stand, it is not the German question alone
                        that remains open, but the question of freedom for all mankind. Yet I do not come
                        here to lament. For I find in Berlin a message of hope, even in the shadow of this
                        wall, a message of triumph.
                    </p>
          <p class="dialogue">
                        In this season of spring in 1945, the people of Berlin emerged from their air-raid
                        shelters to find devastation. Thousands of miles away, the people of the United
                        States reached out to help. And in 1947 Secretary of State&#8212;as you&#8217;ve been told&#8212;
                        George Marshall announced the creation of what would become known as the
                        Marshall Plan. Speaking precisely 40 years ago this month, he said: &#8220;Our policy is
                        directed not against any country or doctrine, but against hunger, poverty,
                        desperation, and chaos.&#8221;
                    </p>
          <p class="dialogue">In the Reichstag a few moments ago, I saw a display commemorating this 40th
                        anniversary of the Marshall Plan. I was struck by the sign on a burnt-out, gutted
                        structure that was being rebuilt. I understand that Berliners of my own generation
                        can remember seeing signs like it dotted throughout the western sectors of the
                        city. The sign read simply: &#8220;The Marshall Plan is helping here to strengthen the
                        free world.&#8221; A strong, free world in the West, that dream became real. Japan rose
                        from ruin to become an economic giant. Italy, France, Belgium&#8212;virtually every
                        nation in Western Europe saw political and economic rebirth; the European
                        Community was founded.
                    </p>
          <p class="dialogue">
                        In West Germany and here in Berlin, there took place an economic
                        miracle, the Wirtschaftswunder, so prosperous, so thriving that this city in fact
                        became one of the wonders of the world. Perhaps this gets to the root of the
                        matter, to the most fundamental distinction of all. The totalitarian world produces
                        backwardness because it does such violence to the spirit, thwarting the human
                        impulse to create, to enjoy, to worship. The totalitarian world finds even symbols
                        of love and of worship an affront. Years ago, before the East Germans began
                        rebuilding their churches, they erected a secular structure: the TV tower at
                        Alexanderplatz. Virtually ever since, the authorities have been working to correct
                        the tower&#8217;s one unintended defect: with the sun shining on it, the sphere that
                        crowns the tower creates the sign of the cross. There in Berlin, like the city itself,
                        symbols of love, symbols of worship, cannot be suppressed.
                    </p>
          <p class="dialogue">
                        As I looked out a moment ago from the Reichstag, that embodiment of German unity, I
                        noticed words crudely spray-painted upon the walls, perhaps by a young Berliner:
                        &#8220;This wall will fall. Beliefs become reality.&#8221; Yes, across Europe, this wall will fall.
                        For it cannot withstand faith; it cannot withstand truth. The wall cannot
                        withstand freedom. And I would like, before I close, to say one word to the people
                        of the East. I invite Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Gorbachev, to speak his own words as
                        well. Let us not speak of the walls and the barriers that divide us, but of the
                        bridges that unite us. Let us not speak of the fears and the horrors, but of the hopes
                        and the dreams.
                    </p>
          <p class="dialogue">
                        Because of this wall, because of the consequences of its existence, because of the
                        obstacles it represents, there is one sign the Soviets can make that would be
                        unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace.
                        General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet
                        Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate!
                        Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!
                    </p>
          <p class="dialogue">
                        I understand the fear of war and the pain of division that afflict this continent&#8212;
                        and I pledge to you my country&#8217;s efforts to help overcome these burdens. But I
                        believe we must act now to remove the obstacles to peace and prosperity. I urge
                        the Soviet Union to work toward a new partnership, a partnership that builds upon
                        the realities of today&#8217;s Europe. You, you who have been in the East, you who have
                        been in the West, let us take a moment now to reflect on the world we live in.
                        Imagine if we could tear down these walls, and build bridges to bring together our
                        people. There is no question, there is no question that in the minds of the men
                        and women of the East, the wall will fall. It will fall because it is the
                        will of history; it will fall because it is the will of humanity.
                    </p>
          <p class="dialogue">
                        Today, as I stand before this historic gate, I ask you to tear down the wall.
                        Let us stand united as one people, let us work together to achieve our goals of
                        peace, freedom, and prosperity for all. Let us tear down the barriers that separate us.
                        Let us work for the day when all Germans, all Europeans, and indeed all people
                        of the world can live in freedom and in peace.
